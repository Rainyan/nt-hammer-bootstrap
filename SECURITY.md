## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not report security bugs publicly, instead this repository supports privately reporting a vulnerability via GitHub.

For details on reporting via GitHub, please see [the GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).

Please wait for a response to a report for at least 14 days, and wait at least 30 days total before public disclosure. Thank you.
